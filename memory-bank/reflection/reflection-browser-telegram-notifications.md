# Reflection: Browser & Telegram Notifications, Symbol Validation, Current Price, Dark Theme

## What went well
- Implemented new notification kinds (`browser`, `telegram`) and extended `NotificationDispatcher` cleanly
- Built `TelegramNotifier` with Faraday, covered with service specs; robust error handling and timeouts
- Added symbol validation via `BinanceClient#get_price` on Alert create, with safe rescue path and clear errors
- UI/UX enhancements: Binance-like dark theme, navigation polish, consistent buttons, and table styling
- Converted channel forms from JSON textarea to structured fields per kind; significant UX improvement
- Introduced inline “Check settings” (validation) and “Send Test” (real probe) with Turbo Frame responses
- Fixed Turbo integration issues by wrapping HTML responses in `<turbo-frame id="check_result">`
- Implemented pragmatic browser notification test flow: client-triggered Notification with user gesture + ACK
- Redirected to index with flash after create/update/destroy for Alerts and Channels; simplified delete via `button_to`
- Comprehensive system tests (Capybara + Selenium) and E2E user story extended to include browser test confirmation; suite stable (1 pending for ephemeral Turbo element by design)

## Challenges
- Turbo Streams + ephemeral Stimulus nodes made direct DOM assertions flaky; solved with service-level assertions and pragmatic UI tests
- CSP and browser extensions produced noisy console warnings; required guidance rather than code changes
- Turbo Frame “Content missing” when responses lacked the expected `<turbo-frame>` wrapper; fixed via dedicated frame templates
- Headless Chrome and Notification API require user gestures; redesigned flow to provide "Show test notification" button
- Pre-save gating for "Send Test" initially interfered with automated tests; constrained enforcement to production

## Lessons learned
- For Turbo partial submissions targeting frames, always return either Turbo Stream updates or a frame-wrapped HTML body
- Design Stimulus controllers to require user gestures for permission-sensitive APIs (notifications, clipboard, etc.)
- Keep environment-specific behavior explicit (e.g., gating only in production) to maintain reliable test suites
- Prefer typed form inputs over JSON blobs for better validation, UX, and maintainability
- Provide both validation and real test endpoints: validate fast, test effect when needed

## Improvements/Future work
- Enable pre-save “Send Test” gating in staging and production behind a feature flag; add audit logging for test results
- Add explicit UI indicators for last test status and timestamp; disable Save until PASS for current settings digest
- Extend email channel test UI similar to Telegram/browser with clear feedback and non-blocking send
- Add admin page to view recent notification dispatch logs (email/telegram/log_file) for troubleshooting
- Add rate-limiting/backoff for external API errors (Telegram) and centralized notifier error metrics

## Verification summary
- All specs pass locally: 44 examples, 0 failures, 1 pending (ephemeral Turbo element)
- Manual verification:
  - Browser test notification triggers and can be confirmed via UI
  - Telegram manual flow verified (getMe/getUpdates, sendMessage)

## Ready for archiving
- Reflection complete. Proceed to ARCHIVE when appropriate.
