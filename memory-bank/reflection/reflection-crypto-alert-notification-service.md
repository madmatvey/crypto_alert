## Reflection: Crypto Alert Notification Service

### Review vs Plan
- Setup/tests/background jobs: Completed (Sidekiq + Redis configured; RSpec running; mailer test adapter set)
- Data models/migrations: Completed (`Alert`, `NotificationChannel`, `AlertNotification` with JSONB settings and enums)
- Services: Completed (`BinanceClient`, `PriceChecker` with crossing logic, `NotificationDispatcher` for log/email)
- Workers/scheduling: Completed (`PriceCheckWorker`, `PollActiveAlertsWorker`, cron via `sidekiq-cron` every minute)
- API endpoints: Completed (CRUD for `alerts` and `notification_channels` with JSON + Turbo)
- UI (Hotwire): Completed (basic CRUD with Turbo Streams)
- Testing: Completed for models, services, requests, workers; feature/system specs can be added later
- Edge cases: Implemented API failure handling, independent alerts for same symbol, and no immediate trigger on creation (crossing required)

### Successes
- Implemented threshold-crossing logic using `Alert#last_price` to avoid immediate triggers
- Clean separation of concerns across models/services/workers
- Robust tests with stubs for external HTTP and Sidekiq inline testing where needed
- Cron schedule integrated and auto-loaded on Sidekiq boot
- Linting clean with RuboCop; specs fully green

### Challenges
- Designing correct semantics for “crossing” required persisting last observed price (`last_price`), added via migration and worker update
- Balancing simplicity with extensibility for `NotificationChannel` settings validation (JSONB + per-kind validation)

### Lessons Learned
- Persisting minimal state (`last_price`) enables correct event semantics without complex history storage
- Service isolation and interface stubbing keep tests fast and deterministic

### Improvements / Next Steps
- Add Capybara feature specs for key UI flows (create/update/delete alerts and channels; basic validations)
- Validate Binance symbols at creation time (e.g., via `exchangeInfo` cache or allow-list) to enforce “valid symbols only” behavior
- Consider per-alert channel associations if future requirements call for scoped delivery rules
- Enhance NotificationDispatcher with retry/backoff and structured logging for observability
- Add lightweight rate limiting or jitter to polling if scale increases
